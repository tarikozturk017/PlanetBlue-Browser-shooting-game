# Welcome to the PlanetBlue.

# Entering the website
This is a website in which you can play the shooting game called PlanetBlue.

Once you enter the website, firstly, you need to login your account if you have one.
If you do not have an account yet, you can easily create on in the register section.

In the instructions section, you can discover the game rules with some screenshots.
Additionally, you can also learn how you can play this game, which is not so hard.
However, making higher scores will be challenging. You can thrust your ship with up arrow key, and rotate it with left or right arrow key.
You need to shoot as much meteors as you can to make higher score.
Additionally, you need to be careful about the edges, because when you pass through the edges your score will go down.

Initially, you will have 3 lives, once you crash your ship to a meteor, you will lose one of them.
But don’t worry, because you may have a chance to increase them taking the life bar every 2 level.
The only thing you cannot increase in this game is the PlanetBlue’s health. Once a meteor hit the planet, it will lose its health.
Try to blow them up before they hit the PlanetBlue.

# Things that will help you earn scores are
•	Blowing up meteors

•	Getting life bars

# Things that will cause you lose scores are
